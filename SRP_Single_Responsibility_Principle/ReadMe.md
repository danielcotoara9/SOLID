SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

- The Single Responsibility Principles states that every object should have a single responsibility,
	and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class - Wikipedia

- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change - Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin

Just because You can, Doesn't mean You should

Strive for low Coupling and hight Cohesion 
Cohesion: how strongly-related and focused are various responsibilities of a module.
Coupling: the degree to which each program modules relies o each one of the other modules.

More Responsibilities = More likelihood of change

Having multiple responsibilities within a class couples together these responsibilities

----- The more classes a change affects, the more likely the change will introduce errors.
