OCP Open Closed Principle - Problems

- More business rules to come !!! => 
- TotalAmount is doing more than is suppose to (determing the exact rule to apply)

     how can we change this code in such a way that we don't have to go in and edit this particular method,
     every time someone(Business Analys, Client, ...) comes up with a different way to price the items that are in the cart
