DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

- Repetition in logic calls for abstraction. repetition in process calls for automation.
- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation in the system.

The Rule of three (Don Roberts)
- The first time you do something, you just do it.
- The second time you do something similar, you wince the duplication, but you do the duplication thing anyway.
- The thrid time you do something similar, you refator.
